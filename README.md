Hi!  
I’m Alberto, a 25-year-old full stack web developer with a strong focus on design and user experience.

I trained as both a developer and an artist at the University of Seville, where I earned a degree in Fine Arts. This background gave me a solid foundation in visual composition, color theory, and creative thinking, which I now combine with technical expertise to build thoughtful digital products.

My work bridges the gap between design and development. I aim to create interfaces that are not only visually coherent but also intuitive, accessible, and efficient. I enjoy translating ideas into interactive experiences that feel natural and engaging.

By merging an artistic mindset with analytical problem-solving, I strive to craft solutions that balance aesthetics, usability, and performance — turning complexity into simplicity through design and code.
