# Hi!  
I’m Alberto, a 25-year-old UX/UI designer.

I trained as a web developer and as an artist at the University of Seville, where I earned a degree in Fine Arts. This background provided me with strong skills in drawing, visual composition, photography, and color theory, which I now apply to digital product design.

Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in user experience and human-centered design. My focus is on creating web applications that are not only visually engaging but also intuitive, accessible, and efficient.

By combining artistic sensibility with technical expertise, I strive to design solutions that improve interaction, simplify processes, and deliver seamless digital experiences.
